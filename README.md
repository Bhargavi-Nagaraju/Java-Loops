# Java Loop-Based Programs 🚀

This repository contains simple and well-commented Java programs to demonstrate the use of different loops: `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.

## 📁 Programs Included

1. **Prime Number Check using `for` loop**
   - Checks if a number is prime
   - Uses a `for` loop to check for divisors
   - Includes proper input handling and explanation

2. **Multiplication Table using `while` loop**
   - Prints the multiplication table of a given number from 1 to 10
   - Takes input from the user using `Scanner`

3. **Print Numbers 1 to 10 using `do-while` loop**
   - Demonstrates how a `do-while` loop works
   - Prints numbers from 1 to 10

## 🎯 Purpose

These programs were written as part of my Java learning journey. They help understand:
- Looping concepts
- Basic logic implementation
- Difference between `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops
